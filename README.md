# Pip Installer with Multi-Threaded Download

This Python script allows you to install multiple Python packages concurrently using pip with the help of multi-threading. It divides the list of packages into threads, improving the installation speed and efficiency.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pip

## How to Use

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Create a text file named `modules.txt` and list the Python packages you want to install, one package per line.
3. Run the script `pip_installer.py` and enter the number of threads you want to use for the installation.
4. The script will automatically install the specified packages concurrently.

## Usage Example

```bash
$ python pip_installer.py
Enter the number of threads: 4
Time taken: 12.348 seconds
Press Enter to exit...

## Note
The script uses the pip install command for each package, so make sure you have pip installed and configured correctly in your Python environment.
